    <h1>How To Make Pancakes!</h1>
    <p>A simple way to make delicious pancakes</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
      <ul>
      	<li>200g/7oz plain flour</li>
      	<li>350-400ml/12-14fl oz milk, or ½ milk ½ water for a lighter pancake</li>
      	<li>2 large eggs, lightly whisked</li>
      	<li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      	<li>Pinch of salt</li>
      	<li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Method</b></p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Put the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the centre and pour in the milk and eggs. Give the liquid mixture a quick whisk before incorporating the flour. Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter.</li>
      	<li>Now add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and whisk thoroughly.</li>
      	<li>Take a crepe pan, or large frying pan, dip some kitchen roll in the oil and carefully wipe the inside of the pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat for a minute.</li>
      	<li>Add just under a ladleful of batter to the pan and immediately start swirling it round the pan to get a nice even layer.</li>
      	<li>Cook the pancake for approximately 30-40 seconds. Use a palette knife to lift the pancake carefully to look at the underside to check it is golden-brown before turning over. Cook the other side for approx 30-40 seconds and transfer to a serving plate.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Enjoy with sugar, chocolate sauce and lemon juice!</p>
