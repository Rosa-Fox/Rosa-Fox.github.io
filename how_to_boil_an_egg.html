    <h1>How To Boil An Egg</h1>
      <p>Everyone develops their own personal preference when it comes to boiling the perfect egg. This is the method that I have found to be the best! </p>
      <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li>An Egg (can be more than one if needed!)</li>
  	  </ul>
  	 <p><b>Method</b></p>
       <ol>
       	<li>Get a small saucepan and pour in enough water to cover the eggs by 1cm.</li>
       	<li>Bring to the boil and gently lower the eggs into the water, one at a time using a spoon.</li>
       	<li>Switch on a timer and let the egg(s) simmer for 1 minute.</li>
       	<li>Remove the pan from the heat, put a lid on it and set the timer again for either:</li>
       	  <ul>
       	  	<li>6 minutes to produce a soft, liquid yolk with a white that has just set but is still quite wobbly</li>
       	    <li>7 minutes for a firmer, creamier yolk with a white that is completely set</li>
       	  </ul>
       </ol>
      <p>Enjoy your egg with some buttered toast, cut into soilders!</p>
