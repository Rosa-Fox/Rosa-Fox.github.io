        <h1>How To Boil An Egg</h1>
        <p>Everyone develops their own personal preference when it comes to boiling the perfect egg. This is the method that I have found to be the best! </p>
        <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>An Egg (can be more than one if needed!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Method</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Get a small saucepan and pour in enough water to cover the eggs by 1cm.</li>
          <li>Bring to the boil and gently lower the eggs into the water, one at a time using a spoon.</li>
          <li>Switch on a timer and let the egg(s) simmer for 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Remove the pan from the heat, put a lid on it and set the timer again for either:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>6 minutes to produce a soft, liquid yolk with a white that has just set but is still quite wobbly</li>
            <li>7 minutes for a firmer, creamier yolk with a white that is completely set</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your egg with some buttered toast, cut into soilders!</p>
